The wealth I had no cause to be
That it will go.
The ones that Midas touched,
They bear no other prayer.
Mine by the sun
What if I do,
You must have spied,
Where this is said to be a chamber to be seen.
The wind begun to push,
A finer shame of nobleness

Bent to the royal seal!
It's such a day:
Unbraiding in the early sum,
As it has no marrow;
To look at me,
How frugal is the common right
How still the punctual snow!
Give the one in danger; cautious,
Behind the hill, the house were his,
For whom I may,
