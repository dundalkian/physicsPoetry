The porter of my night since thou didst break it,
My labor, and my heart, and all have been too glad, I see,
And I have seen
Unopened, rare, upon the pane;
Then sprang before the door,
Guides the little figure
To witness to the Judgment,
And silenced, as the dusk was brown,
The north begun to rock the grass
They storm the rainbow

The wealth I had no cause to be
That it will go.
The ones that Midas touched,
They bear no other prayer.
Mine by the sun
What if I do,
You must have spied,
Where this is said to be a chamber to be seen.
The wind begun to push,
A finer shame of nobleness

Bent to the royal seal!
It's such a day:
Unbraiding in the early sum,
As it has no marrow;
To look at me,
How frugal is the common right
How still the punctual snow!
Give the one in danger; cautious,
Behind the hill, the house were his,
For whom I may,
